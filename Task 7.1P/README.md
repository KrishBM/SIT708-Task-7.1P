# Lost & Found App

## Overview
This Android mobile application helps users connect lost items with their owners. Users can post advertisements for lost or found items, view all items, and remove items once they are returned to their owners.

## Main Features
1. Create new lost/found item advertisements
2. View all lost and found items
3. See detailed information about each item
4. Remove items from the list

## Implementation Details

### SQLite Database Implementation
The app utilizes SQLite database for persistent storage of lost and found items. The implementation includes:

1. **DatabaseHelper Class**: A singleton class that manages database creation, version management and provides CRUD operations.
2. **Item Model**: Represents the lost or found item with properties like name, description, date, location, etc.
3. **RecyclerView & Adapter**: For efficiently displaying the list of items in a scrollable view.
4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Create: Users can post new lost or found item advertisements
   - Read: View all items or detailed information about a specific item
   - Delete: Remove items from the database

### Activities
1. **MainActivity**: Entry point displaying two main buttons - Create a new advert and Show all lost and found items
2. **CreateAdvertActivity**: Form to add new lost or found items
3. **ItemListActivity**: Displays all lost and found items in a list
4. **ItemDetailActivity**: Shows detailed information about a particular item and allows for item removal

## Future Directions

The Lost & Found App offers a valuable service, but could be enhanced in several ways:

1. **User Authentication**: Implementing user accounts would allow for personalized experiences, enabling users to manage their own lost/found posts and track the status of their items. This could be implemented using Firebase Authentication or OAuth services.

2. **Location Services Integration**: Adding map integration would help users pinpoint the exact location where items were lost or found. This could be implemented using Google Maps API to allow users to drop pins on maps and add geolocation data to each item.

3. **Image Support**: Allowing users to upload and store images of lost/found items would make identification easier and more accurate. This feature would require implementing image storage (either locally or via cloud services like Firebase Storage) and handling image compression.

4. **Search and Filter Functionality**: As the database grows, implementing search capabilities would help users find specific items quickly. Filters for item category, date, and location would improve user experience.

5. **Push Notifications**: Implementing push notification when a new item that matches certain criteria is posted would help connect items to their owners faster. This could be achieved using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

6. **Item Matching Algorithm**: Creating an intelligent matching system that suggests potential matches between lost and found items based on descriptions, locations, and dates would streamline the reunification process.

7. **QR Code/NFC Tag System**: Developing a preventative system where users can generate QR codes or program NFC tags for valuable items that link to their contact information if scanned would help improve return rates.

8. **Community Features**: Adding messaging capabilities would enable direct communication between the finder and the owner without exposing personal contact information until necessary.

Implementation of these features would require additional technologies like Firebase for authentication, cloud storage and push notifications, and Google Maps API for location services. The application architecture would likely need to evolve to accommodate these changes, potentially moving towards an MVVM pattern for better separation of concerns.
